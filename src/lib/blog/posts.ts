          'A commitment device is any agreement you make in advance that changes the cost of future decisions. It narrows the escape routes so your later self keeps the promises made by your present self.',
          'Classic examples include pre-paying for coaching, scheduling workouts with a partner, or locking your phone in a timed box overnight.',

        paragraphs: [
          'Financial stakes activate loss aversion. When part of your stake leaves your wallet if you skip the habit, inaction feels expensive.',
          'Social stakes leverage reputation. When a friend can see whether you followed through, social status becomes the reward for consistency.',

        paragraphs: [
          'Overly harsh penalties can trigger avoidance. If the stake feels punitive, you will disengage from the system to avoid discomfort.',
          'Commitment devices also fail when they rely on complicated tracking. Too much friction pushes people to game the system or abandon it altogether.',
          'Healthy stakes feel like promises to yourself, not punishments. They should sting enough to notice, but not enough to cause panic.',

        heading: 'Choosing the right stake for your habit',
        paragraphs: [
          'Match the stake to the behavior’s importance. Critical life changes deserve higher stakes; experimental routines can start small.',
          'Pair stakes with immediate rewards. Celebrate streak milestones, log wins, and track progress in a way that makes success feel tangible.',
