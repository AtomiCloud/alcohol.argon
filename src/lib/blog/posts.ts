          'Participants chose simple behaviors like "drinking a bottle of water with lunch" or "running for 15 minutes before dinner." Every day, they reported whether they performed the behavior and rated how automatic it felt.',

          "Lally's research showed that habit automaticity follows an asymptotic curve: rapid gains in the first few weeks, then diminishing returns as the behavior approaches full automaticity. Most habits plateau around 60-90 days, even if they never reach 100% automaticity.",

When you repeatedly perform a behavior in a specific context (time, location, preceding action), your brain learns the association and the behavior becomes automatic.",
